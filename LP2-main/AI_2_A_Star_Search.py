# A Algorithm* combines both g(n) (cost from the start to the current node) and h(n) (estimated cost to the goal) for its evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n).

# Steps:

# Choose a starting node and a goal.

# Evaluate each node by combining the path cost and the heuristic estimate to the goal.

# Use a priority queue to always process the node with the lowest f(n) value.

# The A algorithm* is widely used for pathfinding and graph traversal in AI due to its optimality and completeness when using an admissible heuristic. A* combines the concepts of both BFS and Greedy Best-First Search:

# f(n) = g(n) + h(n):

# g(n): The actual cost to reach the node n from the start node.

# h(n): The heuristic estimated cost from node n to the goal.

# f(n): The total estimated cost from the start to the goal through node n.

# This algorithm is used in AI for problems like pathfinding in a maze or game, where both cost and heuristic are important factors.

# Algorithm:

# Add the start node to the open list.

# While the open list is not empty, select the node with the lowest f(n).

# Expand the node, updating its neighbors with the new path cost and heuristic.

# Add the neighbors to the open list if they arenâ€™t already visited.

# Repeat until the goal is reached.

#     open_list.append((start, 0 + heuristic(start, goal)))

#     while open_list:
#         current_node, current_cost = open_list.pop(0)

#         if current_node == goal:
#             return current_cost  # Path found

#         closed_list.add(current_node)
#         for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
#             if neighbor not in closed_list:
#                 cost = current_cost + 1  # Assuming uniform cost
#                 open_list.append((neighbor, cost + heuristic(neighbor, goal)))
#     return None  # No path found
# Explanation: In a maze, A* will find the optimal path by considering both the cost so far and the estimated cost to reach the goal.
